## Application Overview
This application allows for the extraction of 
useful information from a dataset in .csv format. 
Specifically, the application is divided into 
three sub-applications: rain, temperature, and wind. 
These sub-applications generate charts and tables that 
can be used by the user to analyze and plan 
interventions in a specific area. The dataset on 
which the application is built is called Dexter 
(a free service provided by Arpae), where all the 
information collected from meteorological stations 
scattered across the Emilia-Romagna region is stored.
