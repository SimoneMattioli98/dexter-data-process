## Application Overview

This application combines daily maximum wind speed data and the prevailing daily wind direction. This approach provides a comprehensive view of wind behavior, enabling effective management.

The dataset for wind speed must be in m/s, while the dataset for direction must be in degrees. All conversions to the Beaufort scale and cardinal points are handled by the application.

### Extracted Information

- Total number of winds categorized by intensity (according to the Beaufort scale) and direction
- Most frequent wind direction and speed at the analysis site
- Top 10 strongest winds recorded
- Wind rose chart to better visualize wind patterns and their prevalence
